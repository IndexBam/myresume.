    <p>
      I spent most of my teen years deciding what I actually liked. A lot of
      questions were raised, because I just had too many passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since young age, I have always loved mathematics and had good results in
      exams and even some awards in the area. For most people I was clearly
      going to be an engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was 12, I started learning English. I didn't know at the time but
      it was only the start of my love journey with learning languages. For a
      bunch of people, I would be a teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still when I was 12, I also loved psicology. Understanding human beings
      and trying to help them was something I would love to do. My parents were
      worried I wouldn't make a living as a therapist.
    </p>
    <p>
      But everything changed when I was in high school. I just fell in love with
      biology and decided I wanted to apply it to studying the human body and
      helping people with it. Ever since this day, I shut all the voices
      screaming what I should be and pointed out what deep down I knew I really
      wanted. I was deciding, for the first time. I wanted to be I doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things get complicated when you decide. It is scary. And, although I knew
      what I wanted, I had a feeling it was not everything I was. I stated to
      question my career decision, when my love for mathematics raised when I
      started studying python as a 16 year old teenager. I just loved it at
      first sight and started to thing I should switch to engineering. I was
      happy with being engineer. I did always love mathematics and now
      programming. It was the perfect decision. If only my other love had not
      started to kick in. I really liked it all, but med school was SO appealing
      too. I was confuse and scared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things felt clearer when I saw that I would be frustated if I did not
      become a doctor. I had the biggest chance now that I was studying for the
      Brazilian version of the SAT and I decided to hold on to it and become the
      doctor I had for a long time dreamt of being. It took me three years of
      great effort and renouncement, but now I've got into med school and I
      could not feel better about it and about my decision
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of my accomplishment, I had almost a gap year before getting into
      med school, and during this time I have nurtured my love for programming.
      Rediscovering this love of mine, has been a great experience and everyday
      I am happy to study programming, develope algorithms and websites. I am
      just so happy to create something and see it working. I have the goose
      bumps every time I do it. So I can affirm: I really am the two things;
      programmer and a med student. And I really love being both.
